Implements a referral system for your WordPress site. Maximize your space with keyword 
targeted links that are ranked to bring you the most visitors. 

== Description ==

This plugin implements a site link list in the sidebar page area. The list is sorted and filtered by the number of visitors sent from each particular link owner as well as relevance from matching keywords. The list can be limited to a number of results. Visitors can submit their site to the list and receive an 
affiliate link to place in their site.

New site submissions must be approved in the admin page.
